  I will be describing the rules of the two-player (Red and Green) game :
  <ul>
  <li>  The gameplay takes place in an 9x6 board.<br>
  <li>  For each cell in the board, we define a critical mass. The critical mass is equal to the number of orthogonally adjacent cells. That would be 4 for usual cells, 3 for cells in the edge and 2 for cells in the corner.<br>
  <li>  All cells are initially empty. The Red and the Green player take turns to place "numbers" of their corresponding colors. The Red player can only place an (red) number in an empty cell or a cell which already contains one or more red numbers. When two or
    more numbers are placed in the same cell, they stack up.<br>
  <li>  When a cell is loaded with a number of numbers equal to its critical mass, the stack immediately explodes. As a result of the explosion, to each of the orthogonally adjacent cells, an number is added and the initial cell looses as many numbers as its
    critical mass. The explosions might result in overloading of an adjacent cell and the chain reaction of explosion continues until every cell is stable.<br>
  <li>  When a red cell explodes and there are green cells around, the green cells are converted to red and the other rules of explosions still follow. The same rule is applicable for other colors.
  <li>  The winner is the one who eliminates every other player's numbers.
    <ul>
